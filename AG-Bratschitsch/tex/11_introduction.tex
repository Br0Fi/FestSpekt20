  This lab report concerns itself with low-dimensional solid state matter, mainly monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and their behavior in different circumstances.
  Here, three different experiments are shown and the resulting data evaluated.
  At first, monolayers of two different and unknown TMDCs are made by exfoliation and photoluminescence spectra are recorded for these monolayers.
  The objective here is firstly to show that monolayers can be created by using the scotch tape technique and secondly the identification of the unknown materials from their characteristic photoluminescence spectra.

  In the second experiment a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sample is used in a photoluminescence measurement using a confocal microscope.
  This is done in order to find a Single-photon emitter (SPE) on the sample and then confirm it being an SPE through an antibunching measurement.
  The dependence on power of the emitter's efficiency will also be examined.

  Lastly, the third experiment is about the magneto-optic effect in a WS$_2$ monolayer.
  The effect of excitons on faraday rotation is observed by comparing the Verdet constants of the monolayer with the underlying substrate.


  %Single-photon emitters can be essential for certain types of quantum computers and quantum simulators.
