\subsection{Single-photon emitters}
\label{sec:theory:spe}

Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are light sources that emit single

SPEs are identified, by performing photon antibunching, meaning that two detectors are used whith one giving a start signal and the other the stop signal, alowing the measurement of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$.
If the emitter in question is a Single-photon emitter, there will be a significant dip in the relative quantity of delays between start and stop signal close to zero.
